## Iterative Screen for Multispectral Index Analysis
![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.5281/zenodo.10846272-blue)

This project provides an interactive screen for analyzing multispectral indices. It utilizes Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly Express, and Plotly Graph Objects to create a user-friendly interface for visualizing and interpreting multispectral data.
 
* [Usage]

To use this application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required libraries using pip:

$ pip install streamlit pandas plotly

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Then run the following command:

$ streamlit run main.py

This will launch the Streamlit application in your default web browser, allowing you to interact with the multispectral index analysis tool.
